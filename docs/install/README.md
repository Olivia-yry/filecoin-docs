# Install Filecoin

Filecoin is a specification for how a computer should interact with the Filecoin network, and individual implementations of the Filecoin specification exist. Lotus is currently the _only_ Filecoin implementation you can install; all other implementations are still in the early stages of development and are not stable enough to participate in the network.

For more information on the Filecoin , check out the [specifications website →](https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs/).

## Lotus

specification
Lotus is an implementation of the Filecoin specification written in Go. You can run the Lotus client to interact with the Filecoin network. The Lotus project is created and maintained by Protocol Labs, the creators of IPFS, libp2p, and Filecoin. This section covers how to install the Lotus client on your machine.
