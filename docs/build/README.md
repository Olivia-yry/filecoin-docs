# Build

Design, create, and build applications on the Filecoin network with IPFS, Slate's React component library, and Textile's Powergate.

## Core products

Here you'll find an overview of the three main categories of products that we recommend to developers, and high-level pointers on how to run and integrate them in your application.

- **For most developers**, we recommend getting started with [Filecoin-backed IPFS Pinning Services](./core-products/filecoin-backed-pinning-services.md). This is especially true if youâ€™re coming to Filecoin from IPFS or other web3 ecosystems.
- **For some developers who want to manage their own nodes**, we recommend using [Powergate](./core-products/powergate.md).
- **For very advanced, protocol-level developers**, we recommend using [Filecoin protocol implementations](./core-products/protocol-implementations.md), e.g. [lotus](https://lotu.sh).

**Developer Tools** provides brief descriptions and links to tools and libraries that provide important functionality for application developers.

- [Wallets, signing tools, and API clients](./developer-tools/wallets-signing-tools-api-clients.md) and [Filecoin Community Resources](https://github.com/filecoin-project/docs/wiki#community-resources) will direct you to various resources you can use in your applications
- The Filecoin [Component Design System](http://filecoin.onrender.com/) is a design system that includes Filecoin-branded web UI components and tutorials that you can integrate into your application.

**Examples** includes end-to-end code examples, tutorials, and walkthroughs for applications built on Filecoin. The examples section currently features:

- [Meme Marketplace](./examples/meme-marketplace): An example application built on Textile Hub, a Filecoin-backed IPFS Pinning Service.
- [Simple Pinning Service](./examples/simple-pinning-service): An example application built on Powergate.
- [Slate](./examples/slate/overview.md): A production application built on Powergate.
- [Network Inspector](./examples/network-inspector): An example application built on lotus.
