# Signing libraries

Signing libraries can be used to sign transactions without requiring a dedicated node. This allows you to create signed transactions in an application that is running offline, on a mobile device, or anywhere. The signed transaction can then be submitted to any Filecoin API endpoint.

- [Filecoin Signing Tools](https://github.com/zondax/filecoin-rs) - a Rust/WASM/JSONRPC service for sending signed messages to the network.
