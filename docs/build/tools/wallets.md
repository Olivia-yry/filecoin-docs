# Wallets

To simplify or automate how users make payments, you can integrate one or more of these wallets directly into your application or service:

- [Ledger integration library](https://github.com/Zondax/ledger-filecoin/) - for developers of wallets or applications wishing to integrate with the Ledger hardware device
- [Glif web wallet](https://github.com/openworklabs/filecoin-web-wallet) (in progress) - web wallet built with Next.js that supports sending & receiving FIL from a Ledger device
- Mobile and other wallet integrations (to come).
