## Nodes

A Filecoin node is kind of like the router in your home network. When you send a request to the internet to view this website, it must first pass through your home router. Your router makes sure the request your sending is correctly packaged and structured before sending it off to the network. This is what Filecoin nodes do. When your application requests information about a transaction from the Filecoin network, it sends that request to a Filecoin node. That Filecoin node then either replies with the answer, and pings your request off to another node that might know the answer.
