## Quickstart

If you've ran through the Lotus installation before, and just want the commands to run quickly, here they are:

```bash
wget lotus binary from github.
get the sha512 from github.
check them against each other.
unpack the tar.
move the executable to /usr/local/bin.
add executable to path.
check lotus version.
```
