### Golang

You need to have Go installed on your system. Head over to the [Golang Install docs](https://golang.org/doc/install) to find out how to install Go for your operating system.

You can check that you have Go install properly by asking for the version number in a terminal window:

```bash
go version

> go version go1.14.6 linux/amd64
```

## Quickstart

If you've ran through the Lotus installation before, and just want the commands to run quickly, here they are:

```bash
wget lotus binary from github.
get the sha512 from github.
check them against each other.
unpack the tar.
move the executable to /usr/local/bin.
add executable to path.
check lotus version.
```
